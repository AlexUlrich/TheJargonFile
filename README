The Jargon File
===============================

This is a public repository for the Jargon File.

It is important that documents like this aren't overlooked and diminished by the company they keep.

As the license for the version published by its current 'maintainer' allows, I am redistributing this on GitHub with the hopes that it will be updated by those who it's intended for. Hackers.
