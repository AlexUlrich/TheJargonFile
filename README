#The Jargon File



##Introduction


This is a public repository for the Jargon File.

The most important thing to say, is that pull requests will be accepted.. This document should be fluid.

It is important that documents like this aren't overlooked and diminished by the company they keep. The Jargon File has been in danger of this in recent years.

As the license for the version published by its current 'maintainer' allows, I am redistributing this on GitHub with the hopes that it will be updated by those who it's intended for. Hackers.

This isn't 'official', anything of this nature cannot be.

Some disagree.

"It's as official as anything associated with the Jargon File gets." - Eric S. Raymond


##Rationale


The Jargon File is a reflection of 70s DEC hacker culture, which remains to this day a microcosm of influence to the contemporary poweruser, IT and hacker culture alike. 

What does it say about the state of inclusiveness in the IT world that such a project is maintained and written to the standards of its founder, Eric S. Raymond?

Note: this is not an attempt to slander the name of an objectively important figurehead, it serves mearly as an expose on harmful obsolete opinions which have shaped the startup zeitgeist at the expense of anyone that doesn't fit a narrowly defined view of who can use computers or be a hacker.





##Exhibit A: Racism



###Scientific Racism

"It only took a few minutes of this for me to identify specific sensory stimuli that were triggering my feelings of revulsion. I’m not going to describe the specific stimuli in detail because I really don’t want anybody to be able to figure out which minority is X. But I can identify three specific triggers.

One was: their skin color looks fecal. The other was: their bone structure doesn’t look human. And they’re just off-reference enough to be much more creepy than if they looked less like people, like bad CGI or shambling undead in a B movie. When I paid close enough attention, these were the three basic data under the revulsion; my hindbrain thought it was surrounded by alien shit zombies."[0]

###General Racism

"Now the uncomfortable part: by any objective measure, blacks as a group are a problem of a kind minority X is not. Lower mean IQ, more crime and violence, more welfare dependency, lots of whining for privileges, etcetera etcetera. And I have had the experience of feeling like I was in physical danger when isolated with a group of black people (just once, on a night train in New Jersey, but that once was more than enough)."
