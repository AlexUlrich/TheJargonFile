The Jargon File
===============================

This is a public repository for the Jargon File.

The most important thing to say, is that pull requests will be accepted.. This document should be fluid.

It is important that documents like this aren't overlooked and diminished by the company they keep. The Jargon File has been in danger of this in recent years.

As the license for the version published by its current 'maintainer' allows, I am redistributing this on GitHub with the hopes that it will be updated by those who it's intended for. Hackers.

This isn't 'official', anything of this nature cannot be.

Some disagree.
